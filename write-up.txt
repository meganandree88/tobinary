The file tobinary.py contains three functions: toBinary, isOdd, and main. For the decimal number values (base-10 number) from 0-32, the main function: prints out the number value, calls the toBinary function, and prints out the equivalent binary number. The toBinary function takes one parameter, num, which is the decimal number value (the base-10 number). If the decimal number value is 0, the function returns the value of ‘0’ without any further computation. Otherwise, for every value from 0 to the number of characters needed to represent the decimal number, the toBinary function calls the isOdd function. If the returned boolean value for isOdd is True, the toBinary function adds ‘1’ to the left of the accumulator string. If the returned boolean value for isOdd is False, the toBinary function adds ‘0’ to the left o the accumulator string. The isOdd function has one parameter, num, which is the decimal number value(the base-10 number). The isOdd function checks to see if num is odd. If num is odd, isOdd returns a boolean value of True. Otherwise, isOdd returns a value of False. The file tobinary.py should be run as:
